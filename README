To Run the Original Atienza Model

python3 OriginalAtienzaModel.py

To Run the Adapted Atienza Model (Our final successful model)

To Run Our First (Unsuccessful) Model

python3 GAN.py

LoadData contains helper functions, we wrote all except timer.

We strongly recommend you run on a computer with a GPU as this will decrease training from days to minutes.

Decreasing train steps in main will also lead to a quicker run.
